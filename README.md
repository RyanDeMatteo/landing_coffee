# Practicum Software Engineer Sprint 2 - Practicum Coffee House landing page

## Ryan DeMatteo

A mock-up landing page for a coffee shop. Utilizing information obtained in the Advanced HTML/CSS portion of Practicum's Softward Engineering program, I was able to create this simple, yet effective landing page.

The page features an engaging header with a clean navigation bar to move around the landing. The menu has an easy-to-read and straight-forward layout for quick scanning. Guests can even find tutorials on elevating their own coffee experience at home with an aeropress or french press.

Guests can book a reservation using the form provided on this landing page. And the cafe's social media links are featured. In the future, I would like to add social media widgets attached to the cafe's accounts. These could increase exposure to social media and provide a rotating, current collection of photographs featuring the venue.

The site runs best at a 1440px width, but it will tolerate variable screen widths without fundamentally changing.

The project is compliant with Flat BEM practices. This was my first project using this practice, and I am very satisfied with the organization of the final product. Additionally, I am confident that all blocks could be easily and seemlessly reused across an entire site.
