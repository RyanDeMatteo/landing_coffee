# Practicum Coffee Shop

## Ryan DeMatteo

A mock-up landing page for a coffee shop. Utilizing information obtained in the Advanced HTML/CSS portion of Practicum's Softward Engineering program, I was able to create this simple, yet effective landing page.

Projects like this are invaluable for the learning process. Through creating this landing page, I was able to better understand many of the taught concepts. There is no substitute for creating the thing and working through your problem-solving process.

It's very satisfying to view a final product, but there are elements of the page that could be improved. The design specifications were for 1440px viewing only. Some of my techniques do not hold up to a variable width, so I would like to find more practical and versatile solutions.
